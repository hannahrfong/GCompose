Any day between \nMarch 5th-9th would work but Friday or Thursday would be my preference.\n\nRegarding the differences in the two estimates, I don't want to waste your \ntime explaining the differences if the 1st forecast was very rough.  The \nitems I listed moved dramatically.  Also, some of the questions were just \nclarification of what was in a number.  \n\nLet's try and reach an agreement on the construction manager issue tomorrow \nmorning.  \n\nPhillip\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n"

Saves on gas, \npollution and helps keep you strong and healthy.  Enron provides bike racks \nin the front of the building for requests such as this.  Phillip, I wish we \ncould accommodate this request; however, The Body Shop does not have the \ncapacity nor can assume the responsibility for storing cycles on a daily \nbasis.  If you bring a very good lock you should be able to secure the bike \nat the designated outside racks.  \n\nKeep Pedalling - Lee\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n\n[EMAIL 2 START]\nDate: Tue, 15 Feb 2000 04:53:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: Phillip K Allen (phillip.allen@enron.com)\nTo: Hunter S Shively (hunter.shively@enron.com)\nCc: \nBcc: \nSubject: Storage of Cycles at the Body Shop\nType: forwarded EMAIL 1\n\nShould I appeal to Skilling.\n[EMAIL 2 END]\n"
