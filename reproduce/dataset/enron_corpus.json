Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.\n\nThe main areas to focus on over the next week are:-\n\n(i) \tRe-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)\t\t\t\tTo be forwarded to Louise\t\n\tThese plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  \n\tThe current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.\t\n(ii)\tBudget (due Jan 3, 2002)\t\t\t\t\t\tTo be forwarded to Faith Killen \n\tFirst year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)\n(iii)\tSeating Plans\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTammy Shepperd to co-ordinate\n\tWe need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.\n\tI have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.\n(iv)\tDue Diligence\n\tWe continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.\n\nI would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.\n\nCommunication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.\n\nIf you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.\n\nHappy New Year\n\nLouise\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n"

We really do but have been holed up trying to complete\nthis project ASAP. We knew that this might upset some clients, but we\nfound that this is the quickest way to fix this problem and get our\nusers back on-line.\n\nWe have finalized the movement of your customer account #s and re-linked\nyour additional accounts back to your primary Login ID (Acct #). This\nprocess was more daunting than we anticipated and having to verify 1100\nIBS users and account #s (to insure your data integrity and\nconfidentiality) was even more grueling than expected. After verifying\ndata and Login IDs, we believe that we are on the right track. Some of\nyou (our IBS clients) might notice your accounts displayed more than\nonce or additional accounts displayed that you may (or may not) want\ndisplayed on your IBS screen. Should this be the case, please e-mail (or\nphone) the information to us and we will remove this information right\naway.\n\nTo our IBS Billpayer clients:\n\nDuring this process, we seem to have misplaced (blown away) your bill\npayment information (particularly anyone that has [had] reoccurring\npayments scheduled to process on particular days). This has become our\nhighest priority to retrieve this information, thus alleviating the\nprocess of having to request that our IBS Billpayers re-enter this\ninformation. We are going to waive all bill payment charges for the\nmonths of November & December, 2001 to try and regain your confidence\n(and support).\n\nAgain, we deeply express our regrets and hope that we (yourselves and\nourselves) do not have to go through this process again. Should you be\none of our IBS clients that still has not gained access to your account\ninformation, please refer to the following information:\n\n1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was\nthe correct password) and been given the error message \"You have failed\nto correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or\ncontact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset.\" This is\nthe easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you\nonline (on the phone or by e-mail [our preferred method]). Should you\nreceive this message, please call our Computer Department and ask for\neither myself (Howard Gordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @\n830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @ 830-401-1182. If you reach our voice mail\n(or another employee), please leave your Name, Account # and call back\n#.\n\n2)  You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the\nssn# or tin# of the primary account holder). Please try again using the\nlast six (6) digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the\nprimary account holder.

Please try again using the\nlast six (6) digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the\nprimary account holder.\n\n3)  If you see this error message \"Invalid login; please try again\"\n(after three [3] or more tries), then you possibly fall into this last\ncategory. Your account is one of the few that did not convert correctly\n(we will not release any information about these accounts until we\nverify that all information is correct and accurate). We are finalizing\nthese accounts today and should have them available for access this\nafternoon (late) or this evening.

Always\nremember that your password is case sensitive.\n\nShould you get into IBS (before early evening [6:00pm]), the balance and\ntransactional information displayed is as of 11/16/01 (Friday night). We\nwill have this information updated by 6:00pm (hopefully), and then\ninformation will be as of Monday (11/19/01).

Allen\nTo: Greg Whalley, John Lavorato\nCc: \nBcc: \nSubject: FW:\nType: forwarded EMAIL 0\n\nGreg,\n\nAfter making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my deferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen regarding the Phantom Stock Account.  \n\nSection 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum distribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% penalty.  This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision of the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee receives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90% of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administrators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yields a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom Stock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. shares in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that in several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated that the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stock.\n\nThere are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,  section 6.3 begins with \"notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.\"  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other sections of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do not apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating \"a single sum distribution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts\" indicates that one payment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.\n\nThe interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that is the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for the Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states \"The value of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock\".  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Corp. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond section 6.3.\n\nThe calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of distribution under each of the three interpretations:\n\n\n\n\nSection 6.3\t\tPlan Administrators\t\tSection 7.1\n\nNumber of shares\t\t6,600\tshares\t\t6,600\tshares\t\t\t6,600 shares\nRelative share price\t\t$27.23\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$83.13\nPhantom Stock Value\t\t$179,718\t\t\t\t\t\t$548,658\n10% Penalty\t\t\t-17,972\t\t\t -600\t\t\t\t-54,866\nValue to be distributed\t\t$161,746\t\t6,000 shares\t\t\t$493,792\nCurrent stock price\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$10\nDistribution\n[INFO: this email was truncated; continuation will appear in the next chunk]"

If the administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7.1 should apply.  The current interpretation of the plan administrators is a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout.   \n\nIn addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the same issue.  I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nPhillip Allen\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n\n[EMAIL 2 START]\nDate: Fri, 16 Nov 2001 10:07:13 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: Greg Whalley (greg.whalley@enron.com)\nTo: Phillip K.

Allen (k..allen@enron.com)\nCc: \nBcc: \nSubject: Re: PO spreadsheets\nType: replied to EMAIL 1\n\nPhillip, the insurance/repairs numbers are actually overstated; they are based on calculations from USPSL owners and agents like us who have helped clients buy and sell post offices for years. With regards to the exercising of renewal options, you might be interested to know that the USPS actually renews these 94% of the time; some post offices are in the 75 years and above range on leases. And finally, the construction  costs are reflective of the construction codes and practices the USPS requires for contractors. These are well-built facilities, last a long time, and can be converted to many other uses if the post office moves out.\n\nI have added another post office for your consideration. It's in McAllen, is a multi-tenant building, and has a fairly strong cap rate. The flyer is attached.\n\nIn any case, I would be glad to help you look for other investment possibilities over here. Do let me know what you've already found, and what you might like to find. I look forward to hearing from you.

I understand you will be\nobtaining the SMEs who will be providing us with expert stories.  Thank you\nfor your help.  Here are a few guidlines to keep in mind:\n\nNumber of SMEs needed:  10\nNumber of expert stories: 20-25\nCharacteristics: SME needs to be willing to speak in front of the camera, a\nmix of structurers, originators and traders\n\n\nI've included below a slightly revised version of the process that we will\nfollow for working with the SMEs to develop and film the stories.  The main\ndifference is that we need to get the list of SMEs by 11/28, instead of\n11/30.  By 11/30, we need to have contacted the SMEs and set up time with\nthem for the following week. I think that to contact 10 SMEs will take at\nleast 2 days, especially since one of the days is a Friday.\n\n(11/26-11/28)\n                         --Obtain contact information for expert story SMEs\n(11/28-11/30)\n                         --Contact SMEs to give them background regarding\nthe simulation, describe their role in the simulation, set up a time to\ndiscuss ideas, and set up a time for video shoot.\n(12/3-12/6)\n               --Meet with SMEs to discuss the categories of content we\nneed and where they can provide stories.\n                          --Send follow-up e-mail asking SMEs to review the\nstories (questions and answers) that we will ask them during the video\nshoot.\n                          --Make changes to stories, if necessary.\n                          --Send final stories and video shoot logistics to\nSMEs\n(12/10-12/12)\n                          --Video shoot\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\n\nThanks,\nAnn\n\n\n\nThis message is for the designated recipient only and may contain\nprivileged, proprietary, or otherwise private information.

However we still need to wait on any additions, based on meeting with SME's today. One concern is the firing of the learner who performs  bad in the final two scenarios. Do we face any copyright issues using the CNN type themes? In addition, I think we need to stay clear of anything that remotely seems like California or anything that really happen with Enron? (i.e. So-cal Waha) In addition, comments on regulatory issues may be a problem (i.e. California Legislature).\n\nSheri\n\nWhen you read all the scripts together and due to the similar mechanics being taught it appears very repetitious. Thus I do believe we need to maybe use a \"Dateline\" type theme for one, and a \"60 Minute\" type theme for another scenario vice just the CNN type theme. In the last two scenarios can we include a promotion out of the associate program for the stellar performers (i.e. title change to manager)? \n\n\n \n\nCheers Kirk\n[EMAIL 3 END]\n"

In the cash flow impact Case 2 & 3 already account for additional cut of 100k from existing cost.  (it comes from Expenses such as projected traveling 30K+Cut in Media 20K + Cut in sim exercises 50K)  The cut in sim exercises need to be confirmed with you. A total of two sims could be cut one.  Accenture will address this question tomorrow during the meeting.  Also,  I will ask them to cut the meeting by 10 min, thus we can go over the documents and can answer your questions.  I am not sure what is Tim's schedule for tomorrow, but at least Kirk and myself will be around. \n\nObviously cutting sims is not the best options but we are considering all alternatives at this time.  We will continue to review how to cut labor and expenses.\nOne question that it would be good if you think about it before we meet is as follow.

There is no labor cost so you are only \ncharged for the materials.\n\nOur most popular size and style is the 8' x 12' barn . This is the most \neconomical building that we construct and it is an easier one to haul to a \ngiven site. This building has an exterior of T-111 siding which is cedar \nstyle grooved exterior plywood which can be stained and sealed. We have \nusually build them with a 3'-10 1/2\" wide door opening.  I would think that \nwould be wide enough for a four wheeler, but you would have to have your \ndad measure your vehicle to make sure.. We have probably built and sold \nover 30 of these in the past ten years. The price on this shed usually \nvaries between $800 and $900.\n\n\n\nYour dad also indicated an interest in a 10 x 12 gable style shed which is \na bit bigger and ofcourse more expensive.  It has vinyl siding and aluminum \nsoffit/overhang, I am attaching a picture of one we made for Joe \nPronschinske.  This project is a bit harder to transport as it is oversize \nand legally you are  to obtain an oversize laod permit to haul it.   Your \ndad indicated that Joe would possibly haul it though.\nThe picture I am attaching shows a common 3' entry door.  We are presently \nbuilding a structure for Nolan Goplin that has a overhead 6' wide roll up \ndoor.  The price on a 10' x 12' shed with a 6' wide roll-up door would be \nroughly $1500.\n\n\nWe will build either style and can modify the plans to meet your \nneeds.  With the time we have left in the semester the 8 x 12 would be the \neasiest for us to build, but if you let me know right away, by Monday \nOctober 22, that you would like a 10 x12 size we would still be able to \nfinish that one on time.\n\nIf you have any questions just e-mail me or call:\n\tWhitehall School Disctrict 715-538-4364\n\tMy Home number 715-985-3063.\n\nHave a good one and take with you later.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMel Nelson\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n\n[EMAIL 2 START]\nDate: Tuesday, October 23, 2001 7:45 AM\nFrom: Jeff Richter\nTo: Phillip K.

Saudi sources expect \"state of confusion\" to exist for immediate period ahead.\n\nIn the West, no intelligence or law enforcement agency has anything concrete yet.

Allen (Phillip.K.Allen@ENRON.com)\nTo: Richard Morgan\nCc: \nBcc: \nSubject: \nType: original\n\nRichard,\n\nI spoke to you earlier this week with questions about building with\nSIP's.  I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I can\ndecide on a builder and materials.  I already have my blueprints\ncompleted.  What I took from our conversation  was to use the SIP's with\n8.5\" roof panels and use a metal roof.\n\nI have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio that\nis also a Creative Panel rep.  The problem is that I have a budget of\n$85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within\nthat budget.  I don't want to settle for a conventional stick built\nhouse.  I was wondering about alternatives.  Would some combination of a\nradiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the same\nenergy savings at a lower cost than SIP's. For example, I just spoke to\na sales rep for Demilec.  He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf.\nThat would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additional\ncosts for the panels.  But would the foam insulation be as effective?\nDo you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would help\nme construct the best home for the money.  I am trying to get a bid from\nWink with Premier based on you reference.\n\nThank you for your help.\n\nPhillip Allen\npallen@enron.com\n713-853-7041\n\n\n**********************************************************************\nThis e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliate and\nmay contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of the\nintended recipient (s).

I would wait a bit for Wink's bid though. You\nsay that your panel costs are $20,000 additional. that sounds like a lot. I\njust did a panel house with a 2100 sq ft footprint and the total panel cost\nwas about $25,000 with 8 inch walls and 10 inch roof. Stay in touch and we\ncan discuss alternatives if that becomes necessary.

So that reduces some of the savings.  Either way it still appears that a panel home will cost close to $20,000 more for a 4000 sq ft home.  Even if I assume my energy savings will be $125/month, it would take approximately 22 years to recover the upfront cost assuming a 5% interest rate.  \n\nCost is a major concern, but I am also concerned with the comfort level of the upstairs.  I am under the impression that the panels will prevent the upstairs from feeling significantly hotter than the downstairs as most two story homes do.  What are some other alternatives that would also be effective?  Radiant barrier?  More attic ventilation?  \n\nThank you for your help.\n\nPhillip Allen\n713-853-7041\n[EMAIL 3 END]\n"

Zivley, Jennifer Martinez\nBcc: \nSubject: \nType: original\n\nHunter, Scott, Tom & Barry,\nWe have been meeting with the Ocean Energy, Inc. (\"OEI\") management team over the last several months discussing the asset management of OEI's gas, as well as  Enron's ability to provide additional Producer Services (including the operations of certain pipeline facilities, outsourcing services and Enron systems outsourcing). We are moving forward with the project and have divided it into two phases. Phase 1: will be the purchase of OEI's natural gas in North America, both operated and non-operated properties, and Phase 2: will evaluate the opportunity to provide OEI additional services. \nFor Phase 1, OEI is soliciting bids for their North American supply for the period beginning on October 1, 2000 through September 30, 2002. Bids on this gas are due August 15, 2001, with expected daily production for the bid cycle to exceed 450,000 MCF/d of natural gas. The gas is currently under contract to Duke Energy  until September 30, 2001. \nPhase 2 will follow a parallel path. We are continuing to have meetings with OEI to discuss our Producer One product as well as evaluating OEI's Havre Pipeline system in Montana for a pipeline outsourcing opportunity. \nOEI is one of the largest independent oil and gas exploration and production companies in the United States with proved reserves of 460 million barrels of oil equivalent. North American operations are focused in the shelf and deepwater areas of the Gulf of Mexico, South and East Texas, and the Mid-continent, Permian Basin and Rocky Mountain regions. \nIn the Gulf of Mexico, OEI has interests in more than 300 Gulf of Mexico blocks, including 83 in the deepwater. They plan to spend $300 to $350 million in 2001 to grow its reserve base through delineation of recent discoveries and additional deepwater exploration.  Ocean's deepwater expenditures will include continued development of its commercial discoveries, including the Nansen and Boomvang projects in the East Breaks area and the Magnolia discovery on Garden Banks Block 783. They will continue to be aggressive in the drilling of its inventory of core shelf holdings. \nThe North America Onshore division of Ocean Energy is organized into five operating regions: the Rocky Mountains, Permian Basin, Arklatex, Anadarko and East Texas. In 2001, Ocean Energy plans to grow production and reserves from its long-life assets while increasing its number of high-potential exploration prospects in core areas, including the Bossier Play in East Texas and the Permian Basin. \nThis opportunity will provide gas across North America for Enron with the majority of the gas supply located in the GOM. Once we complete our due diligence on the properties, we will be working with structuring, the wellhead desk and each of the respective desks to request  bids for each of the gas packages.\nThe attached file will give you an idea of the location and volume of the gas available in Phase 1. Also included on the spreadsheet is a pricing reference point for each package. If you have any questions regarding this opportunity, please contact me at X-36784. \n  << File: OEI.xls >>\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n\n[EMAIL 2 START]\nDate: Wednesday, July 11, 2001 8:23 AM\nFrom: Barry Tycholiz\nTo: Phillip K.

The hearing will be on January 8th.  In order to get on the calendar for the Dec 4th hearing, the application had to be in by November 9th.  I was under the impression that yesterday was the deadline.  Sorry if I dropped the ball.  \n\nOn another note, I spoke to Joe Edwards yesterday and he had some useful suggestions about the addition.   It might be possible to move the addition forward and open up the bedroom at the top of the stairs into the new space.  You could convert the modified bedroom into a media room and use the new space for your game/play/music room.  Then you could close off the existing play room to replace the bedroom lost.  Part of the play room that is bordered by the stair rail and looks down to the living room could be used for a built in desk with a couple of computers.  This way you would not have to add a second staircase.  The walls needed to convert the playroom to a bedroom should be minor construction.  In the back you could slope the roof until you were within the setback.  Then you could place a large dormer facing the back of the property or bring a wall straight up.  From the driveway the addition would have the same elevation as your drawing but intwould be brought forward with a covered parking area below the addition.  The kitchen and dining room windows would still open to the driveway but they would be more shaded.  That is the west side of the house so that might not be a bad thing.  Your ideas about opening up the kitchen to the living room or dining room would still be possible.  Personally, I think opening the dining room would be the better idea.\n\nI don't know if you can visualize this or if you are even interested in exploring anything except your original plan.  But I wanted to suggest something in case the variance was not granted.  Let me know if you want me to try and sketch out these ideas.\n\nPhillip\n[EMAIL 2 END]\n"

His views seem well thought out.  He is short the summer due to the prospect of another 200,000+/day of supply coming back by July 1st.  See attached spreadsheet.  In order to displace Aeco gas coming down to Kingsgate his target for Sumas value is AECO -0.10.  But since his forecast for Aeco is that they will have 30 BCF left in storage at the end of March and current cash is trading down 0.70 or wider versus a rest of summer curve around down 0.50, he is expecting the AECO curve to widen to down 0.85.  Therefore, his ultimate target for Sumas is down 0.95 versus the current market of down 0.40\n\tHis winter Sumas shorts are based on his analysis of total supply capacity versus peak demand. See attached spreadsheet.  Sumas still commands the premium of an isolated market during the winter but the supply numbers don't  support that premium.\n\tIn conclusion, I think I will sell some more summer sumas for my book.\n\n\n \n2.  I will stay after the meeting to talk about Mike G's issues.\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n"

I am planning to build a home in San Marcos as soon as I can decide on a builder and materials.  I already have my blueprints completed.  What I took from our conversation  was to use the SIP's with 8.5\" roof panels and use a metal roof.\n\nI have been working with Johnnie Brown, a builder from San Antonio that is also a Creative Panel rep.  The problem is that I have a budget of $85-$90/sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay within that budget.  I don't want to settle for a conventional stick built house.  I was wondering about alternatives.  Would some combination of a radiant barrier and non-CFC spray insulation provide close to the same energy savings at a lower cost than SIP's. For example, I just spoke to a sales rep for Demilec.  He will spray foam insulation at $1.30/sf.  That would be approximately $10,000 compared to over $20,000 additional costs for the panels.  But would the foam insulation be as effective?   Do you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would help me construct the best home for the money.  I am trying to get a bid from Wink with Premier based on you reference.\n\nThank you for your help.\n\nPhillip Allen\npallen@enron.com\n713-853-7041\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n"

The binding open season, which began July 5, 2001 and closes on August 2, 2001, is in response to the interest expressed during El Paso's non-binding open season in March 2001 soliciting shippers for potential system expansions.\n\nThe expansion capacity will be made available by adding compression to El Paso's Line 2000 from McCamey, Texas to the California border near Ehrenberg, Arizona. The expansion capacity will be sold at El Paso's existing maximum California tariff rate, and the fuel charge is estimated to be 5 percent. The projected in-service date of the expansion facilities is mid-2003 subject to the receipt of all necessary regulatory, environmental, and right-of-way authorizations.\n\nThe receipt points on El Paso's system for this capacity will be the Waha and Keystone pools in the Permian Basin area of West Texas. The delivery points will be Southern California Gas Company (SoCal) and PG&E's proposed North Baja Pipeline, El Paso's bi-directional lateral (Line 1903), any future incremental capacity on the SoCal system from Ehrenberg, Arizona into the State of California, and any upstream points on El Paso's south mainline system where capacity exists.\n\n``This system expansion will add incremental interstate capacity to California, Arizona, New Mexico, and West Texas to meet increasing natural gas demands including the demand for natural gas to generate electricity for the western United States,'' said Patricia A. Shelton, president of El Paso Natural Gas Company.\n\nInterested parties can contact their transportation marketing representative or Mr. Jerry W. Strange at (719) 520-4687.\n\nEl Paso Corporation is committed to meeting energy needs throughout North America and the world with operations that span the energy value chain from wellhead to electron. The company is focused on speeding the development of new technologies, such as clean coal and liquefied natural gas, to address critical energy shortages across the globe.

(2)\nRoles associated within the Desk - <<According to Berney Aucoin >> Admin\nsupport and Commerical support should not be added.  We are concentrating\non the major roles within a desk, any more granular could be inaccurate\nbecause it is different for every company.  Admin support - answers the\nphones and Commerical support runs the books in the back office.\n\nCommodity Fundamentals - (1) Broker fees and Margin calls were added in the\noverview, <<According to Berney Aucoin>> it was worth mentioning, but\nwholesale is exempt from fees and taxes.  (2) Industrial, Retail and\nWholesale was added as an i.e., by consumption by consumer\n\nOrganizational Structure - (1) Communication - Inter/Intra department\ncommunications were added into the Challenges of Managing Trading Function\nand Trading System. Inter department communication (i.e., between\ndepartments within organization) and Intra department communications (i.e.,\nbetween roles on a desk after a trade/deal) (between desks, internal\ncommunication between Marketer, Originator, Structurer and Trader, after a\ntrade and reconciling position reports)\n\nRisk Management Inputs - Consequences within VaR guidelines was added to\n\"Trading outside of prescribed VaR guidelines\n\nSwaps - Types of credit classifications was added to Credit Review under\nProtecting Againist Loss.\n\nThe note for the references used was included on every topic framework -\n*Note: Please note in your assignments when using additional resources\nother than the BRM course material and your own knowledge.

Here are the main points from their conversation\n\n1.\tAnglelides Certain that SoCal Will Go Bankrupt\n\nCorroborating our line over the past four months, Anglelides stated with confidence that SoCal would go bankrupt and that \"he was surprised they hadn't already.\"  He noted that the only reason they haven't yet is that \"they were too stupid to ring-fence the parent\" and that \"their two biggest equity holders were screaming not to do it.\"\n\nHe added that the Davis/SoCal MOU is dead and that all the \"Plan B's\" are \"speculative\" at best.  He also thought that SoCal was being \"naive if they thought they would get a better deal from the legislature than from the bankruptcy court.\"\n\n2.\tBond Issuance- $12B Not Enough\n\nAngelides conceded that a $12B bond issue would not be enough to buy power for the summer and that the true costs would probably be $18-24B.   The only reason they didn't issue more is that Angelides felt that \"$12B was all the market could handle.\"  The current game plan for bonds assumes an average peak price for power of $400/MWh, which Angelides said explains the difference between his estimates and the higher estimates from State Comptroller's Kathleen Connell's office.\n\n3.\tNew Generator Construction\n\nAnglelides was explicit that the California Public Power Authority (authorized by the legislature last week) will \"build plants and not stop until we [California] has a 10-15% capacity cushion above expected demand.  Angelides expects the state to be \"5-10% short on power all summer.\"\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n\n[EMAIL 2 START]\nDate: Wed, 23 May 2001 07:33:27 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: Phillip K.

    "text": "[EMAIL 1 START]\nDate: Monday, November 05, 2001 5:11 PM\nFrom: mery.l.brown@accenture.com\nTo: pallen@enron.com\nCc: donald.l.barnhart@accenture.com, kmcdani@enron.com\nBcc: \nSubject: Interface Design Update\nType: original\n\nPhillip,\n\nThe purpose of this e-mail is to explain the results of our discussions\nwith the technical team after our meeting with you. We need to get your\napproval of the points listed below so that we can begin building the\napplication.\n\nWe can have the Position and P&L Reports show the results of the learner's\ndecisions in previous periods, which will allow the learner move forward in\ntime with wrong answers. This will achieve our goal of giving the learners\n\"more rope\" and letting them see the results of their mistakes. In order to\nachieve this, we will have the following constraints:\n   The feedback will be fairly high-level, as we discussed in Thursday's\n   meeting. We will be able to provide feedback on cumulative P&L and\n   positions, but not about specific actions the learner took in a previous\n   period. We will not, for example, be able to say things like \"In\n   November, when we were headed into a cold winter, you chose to withdraw\n   gas. What you should have done was...\"\n   We cannot save the P&L and position numbers. This means that if the\n   learner leaves the simulation, returns to the main menu, or experiences\n   a computer crash, his decisions will not be saved and he will need to\n   start over at time period one.\n   We cannot have the learner calculate P&L on storage costs,\n   transportation costs, or hedging instruments. This is because the right\n   answer and the available answer choices would have to depend on the\n   decisions the learner has made. Now that the learner can go down any\n   path he chooses, the number of possible answers is extremely large, and\n   the right answers are variable. I believe these tasks will be actually\n   better if we don't have the learner calculate P&L because he has already\n   calculated P&L numerous times in the structurer/customer scenarios and\n   conversion and arbitrage scenarios. Furthermore, the type of feedback we\n   would have to give about specific P&L numbers will not flow well with\n   the high-level, global-type feedback we are now planning to give in this\n   task.\n\nWe cannot export price numbers into Excel because the Indeliq framework\ndoes not support the downloading of data into external applications. The\ntechnical effort required to add this functionality far exceeds our current\ndevelopment budget. We can, however, do some calculations for the learner\non the screen. We can also try to somehow allow the learner to make the\nmistake of using future prices instead of discounted prices.\n\nIf you could please respond with your approval or concerns by end of day\nWednesday, it will allow us to move forward with the development of this\nsimulation. I would be happy to discuss these points with you; please let\nme know if you would like to set up a meeting.\n\nThank you.\nMery\n\n\nThis message is for the designated recipient only and may contain\nprivileged or confidential information.

However, we need to find a way to impliment this method while minimizing negative side effects such as: (1) discouraging aggressive trading; and (2) significant morale reductions caused by penalties which do not fit the crime.\n\nI still disagree with the $1 Million fine for such a minor violation of our VAR limit.  The punishment does not fit the crime. What message are you trying to send?  The message being received is that we should trade less aggressively and leave several million dollars of headroom at all times.  Also locations such as Socal, Malin and PG&E should be avoided due to limited liquidity and potential volatility spikes.  I know these are not your intended messages.  \n\nI realize you have given the west desk significant leeway in the last few months regarding VAR.  We have been making excellent progress towards VAR reduction in an environment in which the VAR calculation and tolerance are constantly changing.   My suggestion for implementing a VAR control system that provides for penalties but gives traders room to probe for maximum VAR utilization is a warning for minor breaches (<$500,000) and penalties for violation of two or more consecutive days or initial violations greater than $500,000.  The amount of the penalties should be documented in advance and should increase with the amount of the violation.\n\nPlease consider these suggestions.  We want to play by the rules, but the rules need to be fair and known in advance.  Also, we are willing to accept these policy revisions retroactively and forget about the $1 million from this morning.\n\n\nPhillip\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n"

The actual NOI for 2001 is around 305,000.  But there is not a professional management company.  Subtracting $25,000 for management costs the NOI would be $280,000.  However, I increased the taxes and a few other expenses to bring total expenses up to $3,000/unit.  This would yield an NOI of $240,000.  Comparing the rents charged to the other 17 properties, it doesn't look like the rents have a great deal of upside.  \n\nThe asking price is $2,700,000.  Using $240,000 would make this an 8.9 cap.  Using the seller's NOI of $280,000 would be a 10.4 cap.  The cost per unit is $33,750 for a 1969 project.  The cost per square foot is 36.58.  \n\nThe numbers would be better if the property was offered at $2.5 million.  Jeff Smith claims that $2.7 million is as low as the seller will go.  This property has not been on the market.  So I would like your input of what the market would pay for it.  If $280,000 is a reasonable NOI, then I would thing it would be sold fairly quickly for $2.7 million.  It does have the benefit of all brick exterior and elderly tenants.  Plus the location is by far the most convenient.\n\nFinancing is the other consideration.  I am assuming 25 year, 7%,  and 25% down.  What do you think could actually be achieved?  Can you put me in contact with a lender?\n\nI will follow up with a phone call.\n\nThanks,\n\nPhillip\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n"

Regarding the utilities,  you and I know that I have had the right to shut off the utilities to a property I don't own for sometime now.  I did not do that because I wanted to stay on good terms with the Kuo's while negotiating the release.  I had the utilities taken out of my name yesterday.  The city of seguin informs me that the meters were read yesterday and the final bill will be mailed to me next week.  Then I can compute the amount that the Kuo's owe me for utilities and send them a check for the rock repairs.  Please let Pauline know that she needs to go down to the city and take care of the deposit by Friday or the power may be disconnected.  The utilities are already in her name.\n\nIn my mind the utilities were never a bargaining chip.  Rather, you and I are paying the $11,000 in exchange for the release.  Regarding the transfer of ownership into a limited partnership, I will most likely be agreeable to this but I want to review all the loan documents with Jacques and ensure that there is still a personal guarantee on the two notes.  I expect to have that done by Friday.\n\nI would like for her to sign the release today, but if she won't sign until I consent to the limited partnership then the release will have to wait until Friday.  As far as the utilities go,  I made the transfer for two reasons: 1) I need to know the amount that I have paid to net against the $11,000 and 2) I had the right to take the utilities out of my name and I didn't want the balance to get out of hand.\n\nI will call you when I am comfortable consenting to the limited partnership.\n\nPhillip\n[EMAIL 2 END]\n"

The nature of the transaction exposes ENA to secondary risk with the ultimate counterparty.

You really don't have to\n     worry\n     about your margin requirements because you still get  80% of the value\n     of\n     your municipals credited  towards marginable securities.  So, the\n     bottom\n     line is 785m right now.  Jan 31, 2002 another 750m.  One thing to keep\n     in\n     mind are 28 put contracts you still have out there.

First, I wanted to make sure our property would not be affected.  Second, part of the land that is being rezoned is targeted for \"seniors\".  I would like to explore the possibility of developing a seniors project ( not assisted living). Maybe we could look at the property mentioned below.   As I have mentioned,  my goal is to invest around $2 million in real estate over the next two years.  At the current rate that amount would cover the equity requirements for 4 projects assuming I continued to have minority interest partner like Keith.\n\nHere is the article:\n\nSector 2 plan geets boost from council  By MURLIN EVANS - Staff Reporter  Home and landowners in northwestern San Marcos will soon have a revised future land use plan to consult for development in the area.  The San Marcos City Council on first reading unanimously approved changes to its Sector Two Land Use Plan -- changes over a year in the making and covering a 1.26 square mile area -- intended to encourage development that is both acceptable and appropriate for the region.  Significant to the revisions are those affecting a controversial tract owned by resident Jack Weatherford at the corner of Ranch Road 12 and the newly named Craddock Avenue (Bishop Street).  Weatherford filed suit against the city earlier this year as a result of various city commissions declining to approve re-zoning plans the landowner says were in synch with land uses deemed acceptable in the current Sector Two plan.  Proposed changes to Weatherford's 54 acre tract -- which have no direct effect on existing zoning -- deletes the 10 acres of high density residential allowed in the current plan and adds instead two additional acres of commercial, one additional acre of medium density residential, and seven additional acres of low density residential.  In addition, the total eight acres of the Weatherford tract proposed for medium density residential is suggested limited to town home, single-family, or multi-family senior housing development in the revised future land use plan.  The total 10 acres of commercial allowed on the property is proposed limited to \"community commercial\" -- a yet to be established zoning district -- loosely defined as to ensure more compatibility with existing residential neighborhoods complete with buffering and landscaping.  A 50 foot greenbelt buffer is also proposed to separate the commercial areas from residential ones in the revised plan.  However, a curb cut envisioned to access this property from RR 12 drew some concern from council members over the potential traffic hazards it may pose on the busy state highway.  Proposed are two curb cuts, one accessing the proposed Weatherford commercial area from RR 12 and one from Craddock Avenue.  While the state highway department and city would have input into the plans for where the eventual curb cut would go, city planning director Ron Patterson said the allowance of the two curb cuts was a compromise between the wishes of area landowners and Weatherford.  Council member Jane Hughson supported the idea of removing the RR 12 curb cut allowance from the Sector Plan, but evaluating a developer's plans for possibly locating one in the area as development proceeds.  \"I'd rather say \"no' and if someone comes us with a really good idea, look at it then,\" Hughson said.  Councilman Ed Mihalkanin expressed similar safety concerns over the final placement of the curb cut.  \"It seems to me we're asking for a bunch of accidents to happen there,\" Mihalkanin said.\n[INFO: this email was truncated; continuation will appear in the next chunk]"

Council member Martha Castex Tatum was not present at the meeting.  Curb cuts or not, the Sector Two Plan earned support from several residents and neighborhood representatives, who said the plan was a good compromise.  Oak Heights resident John McBride, who has been an active critic and participant in the Sector Two revision process, especially concerning the Weatherford tract, said the revised plan better served the interests of the city as a whole.  \"This is not a victory for one side or the other,\" said McBride, alluding to a fallout between neighborhood groups opposed to Weatherford's initial plans for his property, \"but a victory for the City of San Marcos.

I am in a balancing act between moving on the construction and holding until the lien is perfected. I talked to Cheerie and she said the person in Dallas is trying to get it done today, however, she may not finish it out today, which means it will be sent for Thursday morning delivery to a sister Ticor office for signature and recording.  Have they told you any of this? Or do I need to make sure you know when, where, and how as soon as I know.\n\nI talked to Andrew this morning the Dallas office received the Appraisal and gave the information to us over the phone.  The appraised value as built is 12.5 million, the NOI is $1,152,695.  The problem is the Land Value is $1,120,000, as this is what they have recorded as the transaction cost in January.  Andrew talked to me about if we want to put additional costs on top of this showing improvements or other costs associated with the value to show an increase in value?.  I am tending to think we are going to reduce our overall loan by adjusting the Land, Title Policy Amount, Debt Carry Cost and some other small adjustments to costs. This would reduce our overall debt and resultant equity requirement. The main difference in committing to a greater loan is that our costs of points will rise and our equity may be out of balance in the end, vs. if we borrow the exact amount, we may risk being short and needing a loan increase for any soft cost overages. I have been working on this and I am reviewing the changes to see what overall effects each change will have on your equity and return.\n\nWe are firm on the construction numbers given to you previously and we have had a number of additional costs which we have been able to absorb in the overall construction budget.  The biggest is the detention pond dredging which has gone up in cost.  The only area left to work through is the foundation/concrete number and I am confident we will hit that one on the mark. Thus, overall I am comfortable with the Hard Cost numbers at this point.\n\nI am attempting to get with Irwin and Cheerie and seeing if we can get the final Doc's put together.

Can the loan amount be adjusted based on new costs estimates.  What will happen at closing?  Is the major problem with the appraisal that since the land was only appraised at 1,120,000 we would be required to contribute an additional 180,000 in equity?  If so, that is not good.\n\nYou mentioned that the we are firm on the construction numbers given to me previously.

However, Payroll will refund those charges on your December 31 paycheck.  \n\nAs a reminder the Body Shop will be open from 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. today through Friday, December 14, to allow members to retrieve personal items from lockers.  \n\nThank you.\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n\n[EMAIL 2 START]\nDate: Fri, 7 Dec 2001 10:07:02 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: Phillip K.

(186)\n3.\tIs the Capstone 270 units or 270 beds?\n\n\n \nThis spreadsheet illustrates that supply will exceed demand in 2002 but demand will catch up in 2003-2005.  San Marcos will have over 6,000 units.  If the 350 excess units in 2002 were distributed over the entire population that would push occupancy down by 5%.  That would not be a disaster.\n\nTomorrow, I would like to refine this spreadsheet and try to support some of the population and job growth assumptions with more current data.\n\nLet me know what you think.\n\nPhillip\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n"

Calger, James Steffes, Richard Shapiro, skean@enron.com, Paul Kaufman, Susan Mara, Phillip K. Allen, Christian Yoder, Steve C. Hall\nCc: \nBcc: \nSubject: Call to Discuss Possible Options to Mitigate Effect of DWR Contracts--Privileged and Confidential\nType: original\n\nSensitivity:\tConfidential\n\nPLEASE KEEP THIS NOTE, AND THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE NOTE CONFIDENTIAL.\n\nAs folks are aware, we have been engaged in closed-door negotiations for the past two weeks regarding a possible market-based solution to California's electricity crisis.\nIn the room are the major large customer groups, environmentalists, small customers (TURN), Independent Energy Producers, labor, the Western States Petroleum Association, and Enron.\nThe negotiations were convened by the Speaker of the Assembly (Bob Hertzberg).\nWhen Hertzberg convened the meeting, he told the parties that he wanted to achieve a core/noncore structure, similar to the structure in place in California's gas market (i.e., large customers are required to buy gas from the market, with Direct Access available to all other customers).\nIn effect, \"core\" customers (rez and small business) would be served by the utilities' retained generating assets and QF contracts; and large customers would go to market.  \nThe core/noncore structure would begin 1.1.03.\nThe negotiating group has struggled over the past two weeks, but is close devising a framework for core/noncore in Californis (but who pays for the utilities' past debts and the costs of DWR power purchased between January and today remain very contentious).\nUnfortunately, with the release of the information regarding the DWR contracts last Friday, it is now clear that achieving a core/noncore structure will be very difficult unless something is done to mitigate the contracts.\nThe problem is that, if core is served by utility gen and QFs, and large customers are in the market, there is no (or very little) need for the DWR contracts.  Instead, they look like a signficant stranded cost.\nHertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to Enron for creative ways to address \"the DWR contract problem\" in order to prevent the contracts from 1) killing the core/noncore deal and 2) forcing California to accept a structure focused on a state power authority headed-up by David Freeman that does not include Direct Access.\nChristian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any \"out clauses\" that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract provisions.  (My cursory review of the contracts suggests that \"outs\" for the state are minimal or nonexistent.)\nIn addition, we've started batting around ideas about how the State might reform the contracts.\nAll this said, want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear that Enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally abrogate anyone's contract rights.\n\nWe'd like to have a quick call tomorrow (30-60 minutes) to brainstorm some options that we can offer Hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the core/noncore solution alive.  We'd like to try to have the the call at 1 PM PDT.  Please let me know if this works for you, and if it doesn't, please let me know if there's a time after 1 PM PDT that works for you.\n\nThanks,\nJeff\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n\n[EMAIL 2 START]\nDate: Wed, 20 Jun 2001 08:09:31 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: Phillip K.

The complainants request:\n\n(1) that all full requirements customers be converted to contract demand customers at reasonable levels;\n\n(2) a mandatory expansion of the pipeline system to be used to meet El Paso's existing firm transportation obligations; and\n\n(3) that FERC prohibit El Paso from collecting demand charges for firm service it is unable to provide until such time as El Paso can show that it is capable of meeting its firm service obligations.\n\nA Technical Conference in El Paso's Order No. 637 proceeding (RP00-336) is scheduled for Wed., July 18, 2001 to discuss El Paso's systemwide capacity allocation issues, which will include topics addressed in the complaint.\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n\n[EMAIL 2 START]\nDate: Wednesday, July 18, 2001 6:25 AM\nFrom: Christi Nicolay\nTo: Leslie Lawner, Rebecca W.

The main idea was that everyone is selling so it is probably a good time to be buying.  I had lost your email so I sent it to Gary and asked him to forward it to you.  I guess he is technology challenged.  The article was just one analyst's opinion.  He can find dozens of articles just like it online.  It was not important.\n\nOn a different note, Kelsey is at T Bar M camp this week.  Heather is very anxious about this.  The only info we get is through the camp's website.  Each day they post candid pictures from the prior day.  We scan through to try and spot Kelsey.  So far we have found her in one picture each day.  It is kind of fun trying to find her.  If you want to give it a try, go to their website at  www.tbarmcamps.org/index.shtml <http://www.tbarmcamps.org/index.shtml> .  Click on sports camp parent connection.  There are a few paragraphs about each day and a spot to click for the pictures from that day.  See if you can find her.\n\nPat and Gary's house looks like it is taking shape fast.  The Meckels seem to do good work.  I might have to reconsider using them for our house.\nWe should be in town Friday.  We have to be at the camp at 8:30 on Saturday.  See you soon.\n\nKeith\n[EMAIL 2 END]\n"

They did not argue against the collection of the new proposed data, but rather argued that the Commission needed to add to the information to be gathered to include financial market data.  El Paso states that the financial market is believed to be ten times as large as the physical market.  El Paso suggests the following information be collected:\nthe name of the counter party to the financial trade\nthe quantitiy of gas underlying the financial trade\nall the pricing terms of the trade stated in price per MMBtu\nthe time period of the trade, including starting and ending dates\nthe date on which the deal was entered into\nthe type of trade\n\nEl Paso Merchant also argues for confidential treatment and a sunset date for the collection of the data (tied to when EIA finds supply and demand in California in balance.)\n\nI have a fax of the comments, but do not yet have them electronically.

Direct effects of recent precipitation, combined with some very big precip forecast errors, are part of the explanation, but there also appears to be something going on with management of the non-treaty storage that BPA's cached upstream in Arrow. We've been looking into that, and hope to get some news via Technical Management Team today.\n\nFrom a multi-purpose project manager's perspective, I think that current reservoir elevation is one or two feet too high, so I do expect drawdown by month end. I also suspect that there are some limits in the non-treaty storage approaching that require at least partial withdrawal.\n\nThe net effect should be a rise in production-- no more downstream storage is available and upstream releases will increase, certainly by November 1, but probably earlier.\n\nTim\n[EMAIL 2 END]\n\n[EMAIL 3 START]\nDate: Wed, 17 Oct 2001 10:26:33 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: Phillip K.

I spoke to your office and they thought it best that I address my questions to you directly.  \n\nHere is my situation.  I purchased a 32 acre tract in Leander about 8 months ago.  I have a contract to sell the property which should close around July 18th.  \n\nI expect to realize a gain of around $400,000.  See calculations below:\n\nSales price:\t\t2,100,000\nPurchase price\t\t1,200,000\nFees&Devel costs\t  500,000\n\nProfit\t\t\t 400,000\n\nThe cash generated at the sale will be close to $1 million after repayment of a loan.\n\nI am interested in protecting this gain through a 1031 exchange.\n\nI am already involved in a couple of other real estate transactions that might qualify. \n\n First, there is a 10 acre tract that was purchased by Bishops Corner, Ltd for $1.15 million six months ago.  I lent the partnership the cash to buy the land with the intent of working with the developer to build a multifamily project.  We could not come to terms for the development, so the partnership was conveyed to me.  The loan still exist.  I am an 80% limited partner.  Another investor is the other limited partner.  We have set up a Corporation to be the general partner.  We intend to develop the property. Is there a creative way to use the land purchase in a 1031 exchange?\n\nSecond,  I have a small tract in New Braunfels under contract for $400,000.  I am applying for FHA financing for a 180 unit apartment complex and hope to receive an invitation letter prior to closing.  I would need to place this property in a limited partnership eventually, but is there a way to buy the property hold it in my name long enough to satisfy the IRS then move it to a LP.\n\nIf neither of these deals qualify, I would still like to find another piece of property.  My two biggest concerns are tying up too much cash and holding property in my own name.  Is there a way to insure during the 1st year then move a different entity?\n\nThank you in advance for your help.\n\nPhillip Allen\t\n8855 Merlin Ct\nHouston, TX 77055\npallen70@hotmail.com\nwk 713-853-7041\nhm 713-463-8626\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n"

This version of the talking points incorporates comments from Steffes, Walton, and Perrino.\n\nPhillip Allen: people on the call were wondering if there are any informal messages the West gas desk would like to relay to FERC staff. Notes, however, that ex parte contacts such as these generally must avoid issues that are being currently litigated by the FERC.\n\n << File: FERC Western Message Points 062301.doc >> \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<Embedded Picture (Device Independent Bitmap)>\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n\n[EMAIL 2 START]\nDate: 06/24/2001 09:56 AM\nFrom: James D Steffes/NA/Enron\nTo: Leslie Lawner/NA/Enron, Rebecca W Cantrell/HOU/ECT@ECT, Donna Fulton/Corp/Enron\nCc: Christi L Nicolay/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sscott3@enron.com, Sarah Novosel/Corp/Enron\nBcc: \nSubject: RE: Western Wholesale Activities - Gas & Power Conf.

By early fall, the analysts expect the car companies \"to ramp spending back up to support new model introductions and to regain market share from the imports.\" Such an event, says the SG Cowen crew, could mark a significant catalyst for companies that depend heavily on TV advertising, like AOL Time Warner (AOL), Viacom (VIA, VIAB), News Corp.

A climate policy based on reducing the carbon content in fuels would  favor NG, along with other less-carbon intensive energy sources, thus  accelerating its demand.    However, economic models looking at the climate change issue show mixed  results on this issue; many models show the demand for NG increasing relative to  more \"dirty\" fuels while others show its demand decreasing at a rate faster than  oil (explained by NG demand being more responsive to a tax).  \n\nThe Pew Center has found that NG information is often  extrapolated from that of oil.   Without clear information on the true path of the NG sector,  policy-makers will be misinformed on how to address the climate change  problem.  The Pew Center will host a  conference in conjunction with the Energy Modeling Forum of Stanford University,  to gather leading experts on both the modeling and practical side of determining  natural gas issues.  A report will  be published summarizing the topics discussed in the  conference.\n\n\nPew Center on Global Climate Change  \n2101 Wilson Blvd. \nSuite 550 \nArlington, VA 22201 \nTel: (703) 516-4146\nFax: (703) 841-1422\nwww.pewclimate.org   \n\n - Chess.gif \n\n\n\n\n<Embedded Picture (Device Independent Bitmap)>\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n\n[EMAIL 2 START]\nDate: 06/04/2001 03:35 PM\nFrom: Jeffrey Keeler\nTo: James D Steffes/NA/Enron\nCc: \nBcc: \nSubject: Pew Center Summer workshop\nType: forwarded EMAIL 1\n\nJim:  see note below from Pew Center on Climate Change.

Allen\nCc: Greg Whalley, Mary Joyce\nBcc: \nSubject: Answer\nType: original\n\nFor purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA,  a \"single sum distribution,\" in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement.  \n\nSection 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant.  A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.\n\nAdditionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.  \n\n      Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan.\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n\n[EMAIL 2 START]\nDate: Mon, 26 Nov 2001 09:18:13 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: Phillip K.

The beginning of Section 6.3 states \"Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan?\".   This implies that Section 6.3 contains the complete rules for an accelerated distribution.  I disagree with your translation of \"a single sum distribution\" as meaning all at once instead of a single amount.  I would like to meet to discuss or appeal to Greg W. or John L.   In addition, your response does not address Section 7.1.  This appears to be the relevant section if the PSA is to be paid in shares.  Additionally the Q & A section in the plan brochure (pg. 8) works through an example of adjusting the number of shares to retain a certain dollar value.  This is the methodology described in Section 7.1.\n\nTom Martin and Scott Neal share the above concerns.  Please advise of a convenient time we can all meet to discuss further.\n\nPhillip\n[EMAIL 2 END]\n"

I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.\n\nAs far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.  \n\nMy suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.

Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook client will be configured on your computer.\nAfter migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.\n\nPLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook client is configured on your desktop.\n\n2. Remote access to your mailbox.\nAfter your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) for remote access to your mailbox.\n\nPLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA available from your home or when traveling abroad.\n\nHOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)\n\nLaunch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe\n\nSubstitute \"john.doe\" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in \"corp/your user id\" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You will now be able to view your mailbox.\n\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the functions NOT available via OWA:\n\nFeatures NOT available using OWA:\n\n-  Tasks\n-  Journal\n-  Spell Checker\n-  Offline Use\n-  Printing Templates\n-  Reminders\n-  Timed Delivery\n-  Expiration\n-  Outlook Rules\n-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall\n-  Sharing Contacts with others\n-  Task Delegation\n-  Direct Resource Booking\n-  Personal Distribution Lists\n\nQUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?\n\nIf you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:\n\n\tOutlook.2000@enron.com\n\nOtherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:\n\n\t713-853-1411\n\nThank you,\n\nOutlook 2000 Migration Team\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n\n[EMAIL 2 START]\nDate: Tue, 1 May 2001 17:14:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: Phillip K Allen (phillip.allen@enron.com)\nTo: Ina Rangel (ina.rangel@enron.com)\nCc: \nBcc: \nSubject: 4-URGENT - OWA Please print this now.\nType: forwarded EMAIL 1\n\n[INFO: no message body provided]\n[EMAIL 2 END]\n"

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:\n\nPrice caps are almost never the right answer\nPrice Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages\nCompetitive choices for consumers is the right answer\nAny solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable\nEight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export California's problems to the West\n\nThis is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda.  Hope this info helps.

The following assumptions were made to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 existed at the time of this bid.\n\nBid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only.\n\nI am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.  Please call or email with comments.\n\nPhillip Allen\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n"

Any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is reportedly \"unwilling to fight\" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would \"double dip\" into the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.  Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very difficult.\n\nThe Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would \"eat\" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they will support the bond issuance to go forward.\n\nCurrently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB 31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy). \n\nAccording to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.\n\nKey Points of the Bridge Financing\nInitial Loan Amount:\t$4.125 B\nLenders:\t\tJP Morgan\t\t$2.5 B Lehman Brothers\t\t$1.0 B Bear Stearns\n[INFO: this email was truncated; continuation will appear in the next chunk]"

The $5 billion authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earlier in the crisis.\n\nSoCal Edison and Bankruptcy\nAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  \n\nThe second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the DWR proportionately from rate payments.\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n\n[EMAIL 2 START]\nDate: Mon, 7 May 2001 11:54:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: Phillip K Allen (phillip.allen@enron.com)\nTo: Keith Holst (keith.holst@enron.com)\nCc: \nBcc: \nSubject: California Update 5/4/01\nType: forwarded EMAIL 1\n\n[INFO: no message body provided]\n[EMAIL 2 END]\n"

Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be \nrecouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would \nbe paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.\n\n\n\nSince almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the \ninvestment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned \nearlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as \npart of the construction contract.  \n\nJust to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look \nlike here are a few ideas:\n\n 1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from \nhigher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.\n\n 2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase \n1 complete in November)\n      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule\n      -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule\n\nThis way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but \ncould be as favorable as 55/45.

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; \nthe need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, \non Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic \nconsolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time \nconsuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the \ninability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the \nconsolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can \narrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to \nhappen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the \nconsolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude \nbuilding a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the \nfuture, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm \nrequirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project \nplan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. \nThe other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to \nthemselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this \nproject.\n\nI have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been \ngood. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now \nwe need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.\n\nRichard\n[EMAIL 2 END]\n\n[EMAIL 3 START]\nDate: Mon, 9 Oct 2000 07:16:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: Phillip K Allen (phillip.allen@enron.com)\nTo: Keith Holst (keith.holst@enron.com)\nCc: \nBcc: \nSubject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list\nType: forwarded EMAIL 2\n\n[INFO: no message body provided]\n[EMAIL 3 END]\n"

Limited partnership? General partner?\n\n What are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what \ncapacity(regarding ownership and \n liabilities)?\n\n Who owns the land? improvements?\n\n Who holds the various loans?\n\n Is the land collateral?\n\n Investment\n \n What happens to initial investment?\n\n Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans?\n \n Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement?\n\n When is the 700,000 actually needed? Now or for the land closing? Investment \nschedule?\n\n Investment Return\n\n Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment?\n\n Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits \nare distributed?\n\n Debt\n\n Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral \nis associated with each \n loan?\n\n Improvement\n\n Construction\n\n Are these the only two loans?  Looks like it from the cash flow statement.\n\n Terms of each loan?\n\n Uses of Funds\n\n How will disbursements be made?  By whom?\n\n What type of bank account?  Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing \nfor investors?\n\n Reports to track expenses vs plan?\n\n Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?\n\n What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project?  Do you get \npaid a markup on subcontractors as a \n general contractor and paid gain out of profits?\n\n Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses \nbefore the ultimate payout of profits?\n\n Design and Construction\n \n When will design be complete?\n\n What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units?\n\n What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction \nplanning and permitting?\n\n Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, \nvendors, and other professionals? \n Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?\n\n Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to \nuse? Names?\n\nThese questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor \nin a project like this it is new to me.  Also, I want to learn as\nmuch as possible from the process.\n\nPhillip\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n"

This would produce an average sq\nfootage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought his\nsales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell\nfor $203,108.\nWhat is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the\nrent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own\nevaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the\n3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.

More\ncabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.\nReagan\nsuggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I want\nto keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about\nbringing the left\nside forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.\nThat might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the front\nporch would\nbe smaller.\n\nI have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go ahead\nand have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a\nbuilder.\nI just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.

Note that the\nconstruction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than our\nstandard rate of 10%.  This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratio\nof 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.\n\nAlso, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costs\nare high.  Therefore, we should have some additional room once we have\nactual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psf\nwithout overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.\n\nIt appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876.  However, I am fairly\nsure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM.\n\nI hope to finish the proforma today.  The rental rates that we project are\n$1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3\nbedroom.

As you can tell from the proforma this project\nshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.\nThis is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as\nAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for\nthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we\nhave uncovered to date in the Austin market.\nThe project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As\nit is in the \"Smart Growth Corridor\" area designated by the City of Austin\nfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete\nin less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe\nwater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot\nimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North\nAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street\nwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street\nwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond\nrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.\n The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not\nexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite\nsuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the\nadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.\nAs with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods\nis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may\nonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far\npreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer\npreferences.\nThe seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and\nan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site\nplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into\nan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.\nThis analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the\nprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss\nhaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity\nwith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a\n1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a\nrental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then\nbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an\nexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San\nAntonio if you do not know anyone.\nI will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,\nby Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.\nOnce you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to\nschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as\nyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any\ntime.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either\n512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.\n[INFO: this email was truncated; continuation will appear in the next chunk]"

I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you\non this project that is sure to be a major winner.\nI regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual\nevents these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg\ndowndrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.\nOne of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to\nstart the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough\nto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took\nanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take\nmy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra\nin her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this\npast week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize\nthe enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as\nif she will be ok in the long run.\nGeorge W.

Cash Needs\nHighlights:\nSCE\u0001,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a complete \ncash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a \nprogram of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligations \nand other measures. \nBased on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE\u0001,s \navailable cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51.8 \nmillion to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash \nconservation activities, extends the cash depletion date.\nII. Credit Relationships\nHighlights:\nSCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to \nextend or renew credit as it has become due.\nAt present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE.\nSCE\u0001,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to default. \nGenerally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due and \npayable.\nSCE\u0001,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond \nindebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more \nindebtedness if it were feasible to do so.\nCredit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE\u0001,s credit ratings on most of its \nrated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade \nissues within the last three weeks.\nIII. Energy Cost Scenarios\nHighlights\nThis report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess \nvarious price scenarios upon SCE\u0001,s projected cash depletion dates. Under such \nscenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001.\nIV. Cost Containment Initiatives\nHighlights\nSCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001.\nThe Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital \nimprovement component as follows (in millions):\nOperating and maintenance costs     $ 77\nCapital Improvement Costs                383\nTotal                                             $ 460\nThe Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to \nbe eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming from \ncontract employees.\nUnder the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the \nmost part being deferred to a future date.\nSCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and \nexecutive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost \nsavings of approximately $92 million.\nV. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA \nActivity)\nHighlights:\nAs of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the \nTransition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This \nincludes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500 \nmillion and accelerated revenues of $175 million.\nAs of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE\u0001,s \nTransition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion.\nNormally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at the \nend of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit \nbalance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to \nD.01-01-018.\nCosts of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from\n[INFO: this email was truncated; continuation will appear in the next chunk]"

However, the current generation memorandum account credit \nbalance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to \nD.01-01-018.\nCosts of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from \ngeneration are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are \ntracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as \nexpressed in the TRA, are overstated.\nTURN Proposal\nAs part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TURN \nto change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition assets. \nOur comments are summarized as follows:\nThe Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that it \nwould not directly generate nor use cash.\nThe Proposal\u0001,s impact on SCE\u0001,s balance sheet would initially be to shift \ncosts between two regulatory assets.\nTURN\u0001,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and the \nrevenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection in \nthe TRA is overstated.\nVI. Flow of Funds Analysis\nHighlights:\nIn the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a \npositive cash flow from operations of $7 billion.\nDuring the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to \nits parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion.\nEdison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its \nshareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding common \nstock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrative \nand general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes.\n[there is no Section VII]\n\nVIII. Earnings of California Affiliates\nSCE\u0001,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500 \nmillion annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999. \nIn 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million. \nThis increase correlates to the increase in market prices\nfor natural gas for the same period.\nA copy of the report is available on the Commission website at \nwww.cpuc.ca.gov.\n\nDan\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n\n[EMAIL 2 START]\nDate: 01/30/2001 10:10 AM\nFrom: Susan J Mara/NA/Enron\nTo: Alan Comnes/PDX/ECT@ECT, Angela Schwarz/HOU/EES@EES, Beverly Aden/HOU/EES@EES, Bill Votaw/HOU/EES@EES, Brenda Barreda/HOU/EES@EES, Carol Moffett/HOU/EES@EES, Cathy Corbin/HOU/EES@EES, Chris H Foster/HOU/ECT@ECT, Christina Liscano/HOU/EES@EES, Christopher F Calger/PDX/ECT@ECT, Craig H Sutter/HOU/EES@EES, Dan Leff/HOU/EES@EES, Debora Whitehead/HOU/EES@EES, Dennis Benevides/HOU/EES@EES, Don Black/HOU/EES@EES, Dorothy Youngblood/HOU/ECT@ECT, Douglas Huth/HOU/EES@EES, Edward Sacks/Corp/Enron, Eric Melvin/HOU/EES@EES, Erika Dupre/HOU/EES@EES, Evan Hughes/HOU/EES@EES, Fran Deltoro/HOU/EES@EES, Frank W Vickers/HOU/ECT@ECT, Gayle W Muench/HOU/EES@EES, Ginger Dernehl/NA/Enron, Gordon Savage/HOU/EES@EES, Harold G Buchanan/HOU/EES@EES, Harry Kingerski/NA/Enron, Iris Waser/HOU/EES@EES, James D Steffes/NA/Enron, James W Lewis/HOU/EES@EES, James Wright/Western Region/The Bentley Company@Exchange, Jeff Messina/HOU/EES@EES, Jeremy Blachman/HOU/EES@EES, Jess Hewitt/HOU/EES@EES, Joe Hartsoe/Corp/Enron, Karen Denne/Corp/Enron, Kathy Bass/HOU/EES@EES, Kathy Dodgen/HOU/EES@EES, Ken Gustafson/HOU/EES@EES, Kevin Hughes/HOU/EES@EES, Leasa Lopez/HOU/EES@EES, Leticia Botello/HOU/EES@EES, Mark S Muller/HOU/EES@EES, Marsha Suggs/HOU/EES@EES, Marty Sunde/HOU/EES@EES, Meredith M Eggleston/HOU/EES@EES, Michael Etringer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Michael Mann/HOU/EES@EES, Michelle D Cisneros/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mike M Smith/HOU/EES@EES, mpalmer@enron.com, Neil Bresnan/HOU/EES@EES, Neil Hong/HOU/EES@EES, Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT, Paula Warren/HOU/EES@EES, Richard L Zdunkewicz/HOU/EES@EES, Richard Leibert/HOU/EES@EES, Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron, Rita Hennessy/NA/Enron, Robert Badeer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Roger Yang/SFO/EES@EES, Rosalinda Tijerina/HOU/EES@EES, Sandra McCubbin/NA/Enron, Sarah Novosel/Corp/Enron, Scott Gahn/HOU/EES@EES, Scott Stoness/HOU/EES@EES, Sharon Dick/HOU/EES@EES, skean@enron.com, Susan J Mara/NA/Enron, Tanya Leslie/HOU/EES@EES, Tasha Lair/HOU/EES@EES, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT, Terri Greenlee/NA/Enron, Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tony Spruiell/HOU/EES@EES, Vicki Sharp/HOU/EES@EES, Vladimir Gorny/HOU/ECT@ECT, Wanda Curry/HOU/EES@EES, William S Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jubran Whalan/HOU/EES@EES, triley@enron.com, Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECT, Robert C Williams/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT_DEVELOPMENT, dwatkiss@bracepatt.com, rcarroll@bracepatt.com, Donna Fulton/Corp/Enron, gfergus@brobeck.com, Kathryn Corbally/Corp/Enron, Bruno Gaillard/EU/Enron, Linda Robertson/NA/Enron, Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ren, Lazure/Western Region/The Bentley Company@Exchange, Michael Tribolet/Corp/Enron, Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Christian Yoder/HOU/ECT@ECT, Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECT, jklauber@llgm.com, Tamara Johnson/HOU/EES@EES, Robert C Williams/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT_DEVELOPMENT\nCc: \nBcc: \nSubject: Highlights of Executive Summary by KPMG -- CPUC Audit Report on Edison\nType: forwarded EMAIL 1\n\n[INFO: no message body provided]\n[EMAIL 2 END]\n\n[EMAIL 3 START]\nDate: Tue, 30 Jan 2001 23:14:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: Phillip K Allen (phillip.allen@enron.com)\nTo: Mike Grigsby (mike.grigsby@enron.com), Keith Holst (keith.holst@enron.com)\nCc: \nBcc: \nSubject: Highlights of Executive Summary by KPMG -- CPUC Audit Report on Edison\nType: forwarded EMAIL 2\n\n[INFO: no message body provided]\n[EMAIL 3 END]\n"

Technically, that bank lowered the \nloan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of \nequity that would be required. \n\nDid I loan them $1,300,000?  I thought it was less.\n\nRegarding Exhibit A, the assets include:  the land, architectural plans, \nengineering completed, appraisal, and soils study.   Most of these items are \nin a state of partial completion by the consultants.  I have been speaking \ndirectly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer.   I am unclear on \nwhat is the best way to proceed with these consultants.  \n\nThe obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above.  Do we \nneed to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset  and \ngive consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor.\n\nPhillip\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n"

    "text": "[EMAIL 1 START]\nDate: 05/30/2000 09:18 AM\nFrom: Colleen Sullivan\nTo: Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT\nCc: \nBcc: \nSubject: Transport p&l\nType: original\n\nPhillip--\nI've noticed one thing on your intra-month transport p&l that looks strange \nto me.  Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be \nan issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this is \nO.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me to \nget with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and \nI'll take care of it..\n\nOn PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate \ncurve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of \n$235,019.   \n(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your \noverall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects \nsomething else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal \n#'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.\n  139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)\n  139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)\n  139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)\n  231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)\n  153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)\n Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to \nGDP-Kingsgate.\n\n Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five \ndifferent tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for \nwithdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as a \nQuestar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means is \nthat any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport \nlosses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.  \nI'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a \nsystematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seems \nthat you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, \nthe transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's the \ndetail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it \nappears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may be \nan operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollar \nimpact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just in \ncase there's something you want to do about it.  The columns below show the \nvolumes under each ticket and the p&L associated with each. \n\nDeal #  251327                  159540                   265229         \n106300   201756\nP&L  $29,503                ($15,960)                ($3,199)          \n($2,769)   ($273)\nRec:   Ques/Clay Basin/0184   NWPL/Opal 543  NWPL/Opal\n[INFO: this email was truncated; continuation will appear in the next chunk]"

If \nyou need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs far as recommendations, here is a short list:\n\n 1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards sales \nabove monthly index without enough consideration of future \n      replacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be \ninjected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.\n                    This creates a shortage in later months.\n\n 2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet \ndemand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.  \n                      Specific questions should include:  \n\n  1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order \nto fill storage?\n\n  2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too \nmuch gas from Socal's system.  \n       I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their \nown demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than \ntheir injection capablity, but injected far less.\n\n 3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short \nterm prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major \n                    LDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floating \nrate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers market \nand the \n     consumer has benefitted.  \n\n\nCall me if you need any more input.\n\n\nPhillip\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n"

    "subject": "San Juan Index",
    "text": "[EMAIL 1 START]\nDate: Thu, 28 Sep 2000 05:56:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: Phillip K Allen (phillip.allen@enron.com)\nTo: Jeffrey T Hodge (jeffrey.hodge@enron.com)\nCc: \nBcc: \nSubject: San Juan Index\nType: original\n\nLiane,\n\n As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there has been an attempt to \nmanipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.  A single buyer entered the \nmarketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices \n($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index.  At the \ntime of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 \ncents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to \nreport into the index calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of \nline with the associated financial swaps for San Juan.\n\n We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from \nSeptember 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from \nEnron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage \nfirms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a \ntrade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas \ndaily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread \nrelationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:\n\n 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater \nthan the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. \n\n 2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & \nNorthwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and \n       October gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indeces that \nare dramatically different.\n\n\n I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the \ntrades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to \ndetermine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are \noutliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in \nestablishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at \n$4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the \ncalculation of index.\n\n It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to \nconduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me \nanytime I can assist you towards this goal.\n\nSincerely,\n\nPhillip Allen\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n"

The missing money on the \nspreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below.\n\n2.  #1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26?\n\n3.  #3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2?\n\n4.  #11 Missed on 2/2?\n\n5.  #13 Missed on 1/26?\n\n6.  #14  missed on 2/2?\n\n7.  #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19?\n\n8.  #20a missed on 2/2?\n\n9.  #35 missed on 2/2?\n\nMy guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll.  \nYou may have sent me a message over the \"chat\" line that I don't remember on \nsome of these.  I just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to the \nbank deposit.\n\nWill have some time today to work on a utility letter.  Tried to call Wade \nlast night at 5:30 but couldn't reach him.

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that \nthe final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large \npart on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which \nthe keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman \nbegan his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or \nanswer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had \nsome enlightening comments which relate to price caps:\n\nPrice caps are almost never the right answer\nPrice Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages\nCompetitive choices for consumers is the right answer\nAny solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce \ndemand, is not acceptable\nEight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would \nexport California's problems to the West\n\nThis is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty \nstrong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner \nout of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and \nif the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the \nagenda.

I still have\nthe concerns that I had last week.  Specifically that the costs of our\nproject are too high.  I have gathered more information that support my\nconcerns.  Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around\n$10.5 million.  The components are as follows:\n\n     Unit Cost, Site work, &\n     builders profit($52/sf)             $7.6 million\n\n     Land                      1.15\n\n     Interim Financing               .85\n\n     Common Areas                     .80\n\n     Total                         $10.4\n\nSince Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable\nto get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs.\n\nAlso, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A\nproperties.  It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can\nproduce the same rent or sales price.  There should adjustments for\nlocation and the seasonal nature of student rental property.  I recognize\nthat Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates\nthat are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not\nbelieve that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis.\nSupply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance.\n\nAfter the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost\nestimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  He\nfeels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8\nmillion.  We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.\n\nKeith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that\nwe cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5\nmillion.   We would like to have a conference call Tuesday afternoon to \ndiscuss\nalternatives.\n\nPhillip\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n"

But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British Columbia\nHydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwest\nregion with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paid\nabout $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.\nBut that still wasn't enough juice.\nThe Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawatts\nof power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of\n$250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawatts\nof power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the\n$250/MWh price cap.\nThe LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. The\nmunicipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power\ninto the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWP\nis named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suit\nclaims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal Bonneville\nPower Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into the\nmarket at prices 10 times higher.\nPowerex officials wouldn't comment on the ISO power sale, saying all\ntransactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000\nmegawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts\n- for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said.\nThe ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state\nno matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency,\nwhich means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is having\nto compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willing\nto pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.\nThe ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday during\na conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergency\nWednesday, but wouldn't order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declared\nwhen the ISO's operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power is\ninterrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.\nBut ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only as\na means of attracting additional electricity resources.\n\"In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,\"\nDorinson said.\nEdison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy\nunit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp.

Crocker (clclegal2@aol.com)\nBcc: \nSubject: Investment Structure\nType: original\n\nSTRUCTURE:\nTypically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)\ngeneral partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\nliability of construction.\n\nLAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\nThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\nany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\nthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\nall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\nloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\nthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits\nis reduced.\n\nAll loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\nfull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\nthe construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\nnon-recourse.\n\nUSE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\nThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\narchitectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\norganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\nmany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\nCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\nthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.\n\nEARLY LAND COSTS\nThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\nrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\nextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\nprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\nprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\nmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\napproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\n\nEQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN\nOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require\nthe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\nthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of\nimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the\nimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be\nfor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after\ncompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should\nexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot\nimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an\nirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a\ndevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not\nspent no interest is charged on these funds.\n\nThe lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a\nfinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as\nhigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000\nper lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at\n[INFO: this email was truncated; continuation will appear in the next chunk]"

This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000\nper lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at\n$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000\nwhich means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to\nobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement\nprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the\nimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would\ncover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds\nspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the\npreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a\ntentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can\nsignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.\n\nPhasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total\nlot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably\n$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The\nimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design\ncosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and\nlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for\nundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would\nestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the\nloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give\nyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required\nof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing\nis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the\nseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility\nstandpoint.\n\nCONSTRUCTION LOANS\nThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative\n(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is\na construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the\nbuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction\nloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to\nstart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans\nin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any\nconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too\ndifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.\n\nSpec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for\n[INFO: this email was truncated; continuation will appear in the next chunk]"

The General Partner\nwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the\nfee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to\n15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.\nThese fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to\ncalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership\nexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has\nto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or\ncannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this\nfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain\nfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.\nFinally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is\nused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.

Any possibility for a \ndeal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans \nand Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is \nreportedly \"unwilling to fight\" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and \nDemocrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the \nbonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would \"double dip\" into \nthe fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and \nthe governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of \nthe power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.  \nAdditionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term \npower contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the \nbond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of \ncontract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge \nloan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very \ndifficult.\n\nThe Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state \nwould \"eat\" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General \nFund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 \nbillion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this \nconcession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full \ndisclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the \ndetails and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they \nwill support the bond issuance to go forward.\n\nCurrently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB \n31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill \npassed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of \nRepublican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for \ncommunity college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be \namended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, \ncurrently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should \nget paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be \nlikely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy). \n\nAccording to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, \nRepublicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money \navailable in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated \nthat only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  \nOther Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The \nRepublicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, \nLehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and \nthere are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.\n\n\n[INFO: this email was truncated; continuation will appear in the next chunk]"

The $5 billion \nauthorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be \nauthorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the \nadditional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing \npower going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these \nauthorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the \ngovernor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond \namount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to \nsupport.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB \n6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  \nfor purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  \nthe California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  \nbe considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this \nidea  earlier in the crisis.\n\nSoCal Edison and Bankruptcy\nAt this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The \nfirst would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the \ngovernor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is \nAugust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According \nto sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has \nsigned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis \nand the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates \nthat it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary \nbankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  \n\nThe second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond \nissuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) \nstating that the DWR would received\n[INFO: this email was truncated; continuation will appear in the next chunk]"

The plan is for Susan to work with me in \nmoving the day trading activities from the Denver office to Houston.  Her \nspecific goals will be to take over activities performed by Nicole and \nTheresa while generating EOL products with me and in my absence.\n\nSusan is currently learning how to use EOL and Sitara.  She is also working \non understanding the grid and the relationship between all the different \ntrading points from Opal to the mid-continent.\n\nMy plan is to have Susan go to the Denver office during May bid-week (April \n22 - April 24).  I want her to be sitting with Nicole and Theresa during \nbid-week to see and learn everything they do during that time.  I will \nprobably want Nicole and Theresa to come to Houston one more time to sit with \nus and the logistics team, maybe in early May.  Then, Susan and I will both \ngo to Denver in late May or early June to meet industry people and to \ncomplete the transfer of operations to the Houston office.\n\nWe can finalize these plans early next week and make all the corresponding \nreservations.\n\nThank you,\n\nJay\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n\n[EMAIL 2 START]\nDate: Mon, 19 Mar 2001 01:25:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: Mark Whitt (mark.whitt@enron.com)\nTo: Jay Reitmeyer (jay.reitmeyer@enron.com)\nCc: Mike Grigsby (mike.grigsby@enron.com), Nicole Cortez (nicole.cortez@enron.com), Paul T Lucci (paul.lucci@enron.com), Phillip K Allen (phillip.allen@enron.com), Susan M Scott (susan.scott@enron.com), Theresa Staab (theresa.staab@enron.com)\nBcc: mike.grigsby@enron.com, nicole.cortez@enron.com, paul.lucci@enron.com, phillip.allen@enron.com, susan.scott@enron.com, theresa.staab@enron.com\nSubject: Re: Denver trading\nType: replied to EMAIL 1\n\nIn regards to your E-mail, I have recently been informed by Nicole that she \nwill be leaving Enron effective April 30.  This is unfortunate because she \nhas been a very valuable member of our team over the last few years and has \nbeen instrumental in developing the Eastern Rockies trading business and \nproviding our customers with excellent service.  Nicole is not leaving to go \nto a competitor, but is going to spend more time with her family.  Given this \nfact, you probably want to speed up the transition. \n\nCall me and we can discuss.\n\nMark\n[EMAIL 2 END]\n"

    "text": "[EMAIL 1 START]\nDate: 03/06/2001 03:14 PM\nFrom: Andrew M Ozuna\nTo: George Richards (cbpres@austin.rr.com)\nCc: \nBcc: \nSubject: Sagewood Phase II\nType: original\n\nGeorge,\n\nThank you for the opportunity to review your financing request for the \nSagewood\nPhase II project.  Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding the\nproject, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are a\nnumber of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forward\non the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on a\nBedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.   We adjusted\npro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are\nacheiving on the existing Sagewood project.  Additionally, there are about \n500+\nunits coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos, \nthis,\nwe believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious\neffect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requested\nloan amount to $8,868,000.\n\nI have summarized our issues as follows:\n\n1.  Pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:\n\n     Pro-Forma                           Bank's Adjustment\n     Unit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR\n     2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $475\n     3 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $417\n\n2.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unit\nturn over.\n\n3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).\n\n4.  Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can support\ndebt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x \ndebt\ncoverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.\n\n5.

The \nother questions I had about last week's rent are:\n\n#15  Only paid 95 of their 190 on 1/19 then paid nothing on 1/26.  What is \ngoing on?\n\n#25  Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit\n\n#27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week.  Why?\n\nI spoke to Jeff Smith.  I think he was surprised that we were set up with \nemail and MSN Messenger.  He was not trying to insult you.  I let Jeff know \nthat he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the \nproperty.  Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can show \nthem around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is.  \n\nRegarding the raise,  $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay right \nnow.  I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet \nbut I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair.  As Gary and Wade \ncontinue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the \nproperty's tenants and reputation.  The apartments are looking better and \nbetter, yet the turnover seems to be increasing.  \n\nRemember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants.  It \nis hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move \nin that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests.  I \nrealize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and \nyour daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be \nworking in the office or on the property during office unless you are running \nan errand for the property.\n\nI am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this \ntime.  We can look at again later in the year.\n\nI will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend.\n\nPhillip\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n\n[EMAIL 2 START]\nDate: Fri, 2 Feb 2001 08:44:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: Phillip K Allen (phillip.allen@enron.com)\nTo: pallen@hotmail.com\nCc: \nBcc: \nSubject: \nType: forwarded EMAIL 1\n\n[INFO: no message body provided]\n[EMAIL 2 END]\n"

There are several \nreasons that I won't commit to this.  Exposure to interest fluctuations, the \nlarge cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer \nare the three biggest concerns.  \n\nWhat I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the \nbuyers choice of terms up to 30 years.  The existing note does not come due \nuntil September 2009.  That is a long time.  The buyer may have sold the \nproperty.  Interest rates may be lower.  I am bending over backwards to make \nthe deal work with such an attractive second note.  Guaranteeing to refinance \nis pushing too far.\n\nCan you clarify the dates in the contract.

I was going for a simple\nfarmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.\n\nA few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:\n\nThere will be a double porch across the back just like the front\nNo dormers (Metal roof)\n1/2 bath under stairs\nOverall dimensions are 55 by 40\n\n\nWhat I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  More\ncabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.\nReagan\nsuggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I want\nto keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about\nbringing the left\nside forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.\nThat might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the front\nporch would\nbe smaller.\n\nI have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go ahead\nand have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a\nbuilder.\nI just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.  As I mentioned\nmy alternative is $0.60/ft.  I thought that since I had a such a detailed\nsketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan\nallowed.\n\nPhillip Allen\n713-853-7041\n[EMAIL 2 END]\n"

In attendance were Ken Lay, \nthe Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov. \nspent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his \nideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next \nweek as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.  \nAttached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on \nmy discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff \nDasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our \nproposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation \nbased on the governor's comments:\n\nOverview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that\nwe are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing \ncommunication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to \ngo bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what \nthe utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more \nwork to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He \ntalked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail \nlevel.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the \nbenefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he \nwould dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power \n(which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented \nsolutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix \nthe problem by '02 and provide some political cover.\nOur proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also \nincluded the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed \ninterested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a \ngoal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities \nto gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate \nanalysts and other \"nonadvocates\" to develop solutions to a number of issues \nincluding designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.  \nHe was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas \npurchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding \nsome state sponsored credit support for the utilities.\nHis ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously \nunder serious consideration and some of which were mere \"brainstorming\".  \nSome of these ideas would require legislative action.\nState may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a \"couple\" of \ngeneration plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that \nthey are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This \nwas a frequently recurring theme.\nUtilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus \nbasis to consumers.\nMunicipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in \nCalifornia.\nState universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more \nwidely deploy distributed generation.\nExpand in-state gas production.\nTake state lands gas royalties in kind.\nnegotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for\n[INFO: this email was truncated; continuation will appear in the next chunk]"

I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants.  The property is \nstill in two parcels.  Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one  lot \nand is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos.  He has also completed a \ntopographical survey and a tree survey.  In addition, he has begun to \ncoordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the \nsmaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading.  Hugo is going \nto fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to \ncomplete.  The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which \n$14,000 are due now for work completed.  \n\nWe are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by \nthe original developer so we can obtain the title to the land.  If we can \ncontinue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention.  Hugo's \nnumber is 512-295-8052.  I thought you might want to contact him directly and \nask him some questions.  I spoke to him about the possibility of your call \nand he was fine with that.  \n\nNow we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp \nFlores can be used.\n\nKeith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday.  We left very \noptimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project.\n\nCall me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas about \nmoving this project forward.\n\nPhillip\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n"

Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs. \nMarch 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand \nover the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for \ntemperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates \ninto a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as \ncompared with the previous year.\n\nLooking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary \nreductions (as opposed to \"forced\" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other \nforecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making \ntotal year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.  \nThis scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple \nmore percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6% \ndecrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the \nretail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it \nis possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last \nyear.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in \nJun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation \nare being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of \nmeeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general \neconomic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least \nmake the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.\n\nNote that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area \nonly, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC \n(U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO \nportion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in \ndemand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As \nyou are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum \nsmelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at \nleast through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its \nwish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several \nmining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are \nsharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly \nhow many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.  \nOther large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif's \neconomic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest of \nthe WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I \nthink we could easily expect an additional\n[INFO: this email was truncated; continuation will appear in the next chunk]"

Exodus is now wrapping up \nconstruction\n                  on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than \na mile from its\n                  original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several \nfiber optic backbones, the\n                  Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and \neventually\n                  house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, \nMicrosoft and Onvia.com. \n\n                       Exodus is not the only company building massive data \ncenters near Seattle.\n                  More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, \nGlobix and\n                  HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house \nthe networking\n                  equipment of the Internet economy. \n\n                       It is a big business that could have an effect on \neverything from your\n                  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access \nyour favorite Web sites.\n\n                       Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and \nserver farms, are\n                  sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent \nValley that some\n                  have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and \nPuget Sound\n                  Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, \nhigh-security\n                  facilities. \n\n                       \"We are talking to about half a dozen customers that \nare requesting 445\n                  megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,\" \nsaid Karl\n                  Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound \nEnergy. \"That is\n                  the equivalent of six oil refineries.\" \n\n                       A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, \nthe rise of the Internet\n                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their \nheads. \n\n                       Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington \nUtilities and\n                  Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new \ndata centers. The\n                  tariff is designed to protect the company's existing \nresidential and business\n                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations \nnecessary to support\n                  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 \nmillion each,\n                  Karzmar said. \n\n                       Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to \nbring up the data center\n                  issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting. \n\n                       For the utilities that provide power to homes, \nbusinesses and schools in the\n                  region, this is a new and complex issue. \n\n                       On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing \nappetite for power --\n                  represent potentially lucrative business customers.

Sabey Corp. re-purchased \nthe 1.35 million\n                  square-foot Intergate East facility last September from \nBoeing Space &\n                  Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased \n92 percent of the\n                  six-building complex to seven different co-location \ncompanies. \n\n                       \"It is probably the largest data center park in the \ncountry,\" boasts Laurent\n                  Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey.

Poole \nclaims his firm is\n                  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in \nthe country. \n\n                       As more people access the Internet and conduct \nbandwidth-heavy tasks\n                  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for \nco-location space in\n                  Seattle continues to escalate. \n\n                       But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center \nspace is growing at a\n                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, \ncausing similar\n                  concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and \nCalifornia. \n\n                       Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location \nspace, plans to nearly\n                  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. \nWhile companies\n                  such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many \nhigh-tech companies\n                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such \nas Exodus that\n                  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic \nmanagement. \n\n                       \"We have 2 million square feet of space under \nconstruction and we plan to\n                  double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more \ndemand right now\n                  than data center space,\" said Steve Porter, an account \nexecutive at Exodus in\n                  Seattle. \n\n                       The booming market for co-location space has left some \nin the local utility\n                  industry perplexed. \n\n                      \n[INFO: this email was truncated; continuation will appear in the next chunk]"

The \nWSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS, \nwhich comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposes \nthe CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, but \nthere can be a siginificant difference between \"scheduled\" and \"actual\" \ngeneration.  You are pulling \"scheduled.\"  If someone doesn't schedule their \ngeneration and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you \nwill miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern california \nmunis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is, \nif they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply \nschedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having said \nall of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on \nthe generation side.\n\nOn the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  While \nthey don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is \nbetter than the \"scheduled\" number.  The utilities play lots of game on the \nload side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.\n\nI think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this with \nothers up here once you have it finished.  I'd like to see how much gas \ndemand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity, \nespecially compared to all gas consumption.  I was surprised by how small the \nUEG consumption was compared to other uses.  If it is the largest marginal \nconsumer then it is obviously a different story.\n\nLet's talk.\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n\n[EMAIL 2 START]\nDate: Mon, 12 Jun 2000 03:56:00 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: Phillip K Allen (phillip.allen@enron.com)\nTo: Matthew Lenhart (matthew.lenhart@enron.com)\nCc: \nBcc: \nSubject: Thoughts on Presentation\nType: forwarded EMAIL 1\n\n[INFO: no message body provided]\n[EMAIL 2 END]\n"

They do not want the school\nto come back at a later date for something different.  Doug Bell will meet\nwith a school official on Monday to see what their thoughts are about the\nsubject.  It would be hard for them to change the current agreement, but AMF\nwants something in writing to that effect.  I spoke to AMF's attorney today,\nand explained the situation.  They are OK with deal if AMF is satisfied.\n\nAMF's broker said that they will be ready to submit their site plan after\nthe March 29 hearing.  We may close this deal in April.\n\nThe Stage is still on go.  An assumption package has been sent to the buyer,\nand I have overnighted a copy of the contract and a description of the\ndetails to Wayne McCoy.\n\nI will be gone Thurs. and Fri. of this week.

Negotiations with SCE on this proposal are essentially \ncomplete.  PG&E is OK with the docs.  All QFs but Calpine have agreed with \nthe IEP proposal -- Under the proposal, PG&E would \"retain\" $106 million (of \nwhat, I'm not sure -- I think they mean a refund to PG&E from QFs who \nswitched to PX pricing). The money would come from changing the basis for the \nQF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December \n(and maybe earlier).\n\nPG&E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the \nForce Majeure notices off the table. QFs are asking IEP to attempt to get \nsome assurances of payment. \n\nSCE has defaulted with its QFs; PG&E has not yet -- but big payments are due \non 2/2/01.\n\nFor gas-fired QFs -- Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PG&E's \npurchases from such QFs. Two people are negotiating the these agreements \n(Elcantar and Bloom), but they are going very slowly. Not clear this can be \nresolved. Batten and Keeley are refereeing this.  No discussions on this \noccurred today.\n\nStatus of legislation -- Keeley left town for the night, so not much will \nhappen on the QFs.Assembly and Senate realize they have to work together.  \nPlan to meld together AB 1 with Hertzberg's new bill .

Their version includes the salary of a \nsuperintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third \nparty subs and materials.  Then there is a layer of \"construction management\" \nfees of 10%.  There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be \npaid out of this money.  But I think the majority of it is profit.  Finally \nthe builders profit of 1.4 million.\n\nKeith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out \nof the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit.  After all, if \nthey are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors?  \nWe were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition \nto the superintendent costs.  George claims that all of these costs have been \nin the cost estimates that we have been using.  I reviewed the estimates and \nthe superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction management \nfee is included.\n\nGeorge gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard.  I will \nreview and let you know what I think.\n\nThe GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention.  They are agreeable to \nthe 3 out 4 approval process.\n\nLet me know if you have opinions or sources that I can use to push for  only \ntrue costs + 1.4 million.\n\nPhillip\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n"

Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and \nrepairs.  Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor \ncost for repairs.  There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on \nrepairs.\n\n2.  What is an outside management firm going to do?  A full time onsite \nmanager is all that is required.  As I mentioned the prior manager has \ninterest in returning.  Another alternative would be to hire a male manager \nthat could do more make readies and lawn care.  If you turn it over to a \nmanagement company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager \nonsite.\n\n3.  Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated.  If you \nwant to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest.\n\n4.  Getting cash out is not a priority to me.  So I am willing to structure \nthis deal with minimum cash.  A 10% note actually attractive. See below.\n\nMy job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property.  This property \ndefinitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort.\n\n\nSales Price  705,000\n\n1st Lien   473,500\n\n2nd Lien  225,000\n\nTransfer fee    7,500\n\nCash required   14,500\n\n\nNOI   100,000\n\n1st Lien    47,292\n\n2nd Lien   23,694\n\nCash flow  29,014\n\nCash on cash  200%\n\n\nThese numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K then \ncash on cash return would be more like 300%.   This doesn't reflect the \nadditional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years \nfor a higher price.\n\nDo you want to reconsider?  Let me know.\n\nPhillip\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n"

Traders put the two together, anticipated a \nsupply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. \n\n\"Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,\" said William Burson, \na trader. \"It makes the market for natural gas.\" \n\nBut the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas \nAssociation's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the \nstorage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the \nnumbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than \nreality. \n\n\"It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what \nwe are reporting,\" McGill said. \n\nAs consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- \nand culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing \nfingers at Wall Street. \n\nStephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently \nstepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for \nthe rise in gas prices. \n\n\"It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated,\" Adik \ntold the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. \n\nIn California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric \nutility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. \n\nCloser to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame \nfor this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their \ncustomers and constituents from such price spikes. \n\nMost utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take \nprecautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price \ninsurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas \nprices before they soared. \n\n\"We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,\" said Paul \nSnider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. \n\nBut critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. \n\n\"There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to \nchange,\" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security \nAnalysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. \n\n\nHot topic \n\nConsumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In \nmany circles, little else is discussed. \n\nThe Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is \nfacing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the \nprevious December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as \nwell. \n\nThe Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of \nhis salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial \npledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. \n\n\"It's the talk of the town here,\" he said. \n\nA year ago that wasn't a fear.

Church members are suffering from higher bills as \nwell. \n\nThe Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of \nhis salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial \npledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. \n\n\"It's the talk of the town here,\" he said. \n\nA year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per \nthousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile \nto drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by \ncustomers. \n\nBut trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand \ncubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage \nfor winter. \n\nThere was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, \nprices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information \nAdministration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating \nbills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. \n\nBut $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, \nincluding the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas \nmarkets. \n\n\"It's all about the weather,\" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. \n\nWholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York \ntraders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile \ncommodity in the world. \n\n\nSetting the price \n\nIn the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of \ngas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading \ncontracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had \nwidespread influence over gas prices. \n\nThe futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon \nas next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale \nprices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from \nutilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what \nthey pay for the gas they expect to use. \n\nThere are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention \nof actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge \nof natural gas. \n\nBut if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to \nknow much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all \nfutures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to \ntheir volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money \nin a short time. \n\nAs December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less \nthan $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. \nMuch of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's \nweekly storage numbers. \n\nUtilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to \nneed in the winter. \n\nGoing into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than \naverage, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in \nhopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop.\n[INFO: this email was truncated; continuation will appear in the next chunk]"

But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the \nconcerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. \n\nThen the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage \nnumbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the \nassociation's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. \n\nBut some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice \npresident of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had \ncontinued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. \n\n\"I was getting worried,\" he said. \n\nThen suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. \nWednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices \ndropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. \n\n\nJust passing through \n\nSome utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but \npass their fuel costs on to customers. \n\nAmong area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas \ncharge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas \nEnergy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. \n\nSheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last \nmonth that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could \nbe done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve \nenergy. \n\nKansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to \nsave an average customer about $25 this winter. \n\nMissouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an \nextension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not \nguarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. \n\nNow utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left \ncustomers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether \nthey should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel \ncosts. \n\nOn Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public \nCounsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to \nperform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices. \n\n\"Consumers are taking all the risk,\" Micheel said. \"It's time to consider \nsome changes.\" \n\n\nTo reach Steve Everly, call (816) 234-4455 or send e-mail to \nseverly@kcstar.com. \n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--\nAll content , 2001 The Kansas City Star\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n"

I still have the \nconcerns that I had last week.  Specifically that the costs of our project \nare too high.  I have gathered more information that support my concerns.  \nBased on my research, I believe the project should cost around $10.5 \nmillion.  The components are as follows:\n\n Unit Cost, Site work, &\n builders profit($52/sf)   $7.6 million\n\n Land      1.15\n\n Interim Financing     .85\n\n Common Areas       .80\n\n Total     $10.4\n\nSince Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable to \nget comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs.  \n\nAlso, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A \nproperties.  It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can produce \nthe same rent or sales price.  There should adjustments for location and the \nseasonal nature of student rental property.  I recognize that Sagewood is \ncurrently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates that are closer to \nthe appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not believe that the market \nwill sustain these levels on a permanent basis.  Supply will inevitablely \nincrease to drive this market more in balance.\n\nAfter the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost \nestimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  He \nfeels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8 million.  \nWe would not even be able to cover the interim financing.\n\nKeith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that we \ncannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5 million.   \nWe would like to have a conference call tomorrow to discuss alternatives.\n\nPhillip\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n"

The agency said it had\nbeen telling California's Department of Water Resources that the\nsales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended.\n\nCal-ISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today than\nyesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back.\nYesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California because\nof concerns about its water reserves.

The following assumptions were made \nto establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal \ncapacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and \nwithdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 \nexisted at the time of this bid.\n\nBid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above \nassumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only.\n\nI am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.  Please call or email \nwith comments.\n\nPhillip Allen\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n"

I hope we can put the past behind us.  Sounds \nlike you have been busy.  Congratulations on the new baby.  Judging from your \nemail all is well with you.   That's great.  \n\nWe did have another girl in December, (Evelyn Grace).  Three is it for us.  \nWhat's your target?  The other two are doing well.  Soccer, T-ball, and bike \nriding keeps them busy.  They could use some of Cole's coordination.\n\nMy fitness program is not as intense as yours right now.  I am just on \nmaintenance.  You will be surprised to hear that Hunter is a fanatical \ncyclist.  We have been riding to work twice a week for the last few months.  \nHe never misses, rain or shine.  Sometimes we even hit the trails in Memorial \nPark on Saturdays.   Mountain biking is not as hard as a 50 mile trip on the \nroad.  I would like to dust off my road bike and go for a ride some Saturday.\n\nI would like to hear more about your new job.  Maybe we could grab lunch \nsometime.  \n\nPhillip\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n"

I have shifted \nto a slightly different plan.  There were too many design items that I could \nnot work out in the plan we discussed previously.  Now, I am leaning more \ntowards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center.  One \nwing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 \nkid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs.  The other wing would have a garage + \nguestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs.  This \nplan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the \ncourtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor \nliving.  I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west. \n The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass \nskylights supported by metal posts.  I am envisioning the two wings to have \nsingle slope roofs that are not connected to the center building.  \n\nI don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe.  I would \nlike to come and visit you again this month.  If it would work for you, I \nwould like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm.  I \nwould like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we \ndidn't have time for.  I can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan. \n\nCall or email to let me know if this would work for you.  \npallen70@hotmail.com or 713-463-8626(home), 713-853-7041(work)\n\n\nPhillip Allen\n\n\nPS.

I was going for a simple\nfarmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.\n\nA few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:\n\nThere will be a double porch across the back just like the front\nNo dormers (Metal roof)\n1/2 bath under stairs\nOverall dimensions are 55 by 40\n\n\nWhat I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  More\ncabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.\nReagan\nsuggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I want\nto keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about\nbringing the left\nside forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.\nThat might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the front\nporch would\nbe smaller.\n\nI have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go ahead\nand have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a\nbuilder.\nI just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.  As I mentioned\nmy alternative is $0.60/ft.  I thought that since I had a such a detailed\nsketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan\nallowed.\n\nPhillip Allen\n713-853-7041\n[EMAIL 2 END]\n\n[EMAIL 3 START]\nDate: 03/29/2001 07:36:51 AM\nFrom: postmaster@caprock.net\nTo: Phillip.K.Allen@enron.com\nCc: \nBcc: \nSubject: Nondeliverable mail\nType: original\n\n------Transcript of session follows -------\nscsatkfa@caprock.net\nThe user's email name is not found.\n[EMAIL 3 END]\n\n[EMAIL 4 START]\nDate: Thu, 29 Mar 2001 02:03:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: Phillip K Allen (phillip.allen@enron.com)\nTo: scsatkfa@caprock.net\nCc: \nBcc: \nSubject: Nondeliverable mail\nType: forwarded EMAIL 3\n\n[INFO: no message body provided]\n[EMAIL 4 END]\n"

This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their \ncommissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) \nshould look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month \nindex may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That \nrisk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of \ntheir PGA's and see if there is an opportunity.\n\nAs to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?

More cabinets, \nmaybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.    Reagan \nsuggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I want to \nkeep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about bringing the \nleft\nside forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.  That \nmight look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the front porch \nwould \nbe smaller.\n\nI have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go ahead and \nhave the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a builder.\nI just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.  As I mentioned my \nalternative is $0.60/ft.

Review risk books-  Is Enron accurately accounting for physical \nimbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions?\n\n4.  Lead trading track program-  Recruit, oversee rotations, design training \ncourses, review progress and make cuts.\n\n5.  Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts.  Are we looking at \neverything we should?  Putting a person with a trading mentality should add \n   some value and direction to the group.\n\n\nIn fact there is so much work she could do that you probably need a second MD \nto work part time to get it done.\n\nPhillip\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n"

The \nitems I listed moved dramatically.  Also, some of the questions were just \nclarification of what was in a number.  \n\nLet's try and reach an agreement on the construction manager issue tomorrow \nmorning.  \n\nPhillip\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n"

Phillip, I wish we \ncould accommodate this request; however, The Body Shop does not have the \ncapacity nor can assume the responsibility for storing cycles on a daily \nbasis.  If you bring a very good lock you should be able to secure the bike \nat the designated outside racks.  \n\nKeep Pedalling - Lee\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n\n[EMAIL 2 START]\nDate: Tue, 15 Feb 2000 04:53:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: Phillip K Allen (phillip.allen@enron.com)\nTo: Hunter S Shively (hunter.shively@enron.com)\nCc: \nBcc: \nSubject: Storage of Cycles at the Body Shop\nType: forwarded EMAIL 1\n\nShould I appeal to Skilling.\n[EMAIL 2 END]\n"
