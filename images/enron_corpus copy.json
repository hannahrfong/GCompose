Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.\n\nThe main areas to focus on over the next week are:-\n\n(i) \tRe-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)\t\t\t\tTo be forwarded to Louise\t\n\tThese plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  \n\tThe current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.\t\n(ii)\tBudget (due Jan 3, 2002)\t\t\t\t\t\tTo be forwarded to Faith Killen \n\tFirst year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)\n(iii)\tSeating Plans\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTammy Shepperd to co-ordinate\n\tWe need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.\n\tI have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.\n(iv)\tDue Diligence\n\tWe continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.\n\nI would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.\n\nCommunication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.\n\nIf you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.\n\nHappy New Year\n\nLouise\n[EMAIL 1 END]\n"

We really do but have been holed up trying to complete\nthis project ASAP. We knew that this might upset some clients, but we\nfound that this is the quickest way to fix this problem and get our\nusers back on-line.\n\nWe have finalized the movement of your customer account #s and re-linked\nyour additional accounts back to your primary Login ID (Acct #). This\nprocess was more daunting than we anticipated and having to verify 1100\nIBS users and account #s (to insure your data integrity and\nconfidentiality) was even more grueling than expected. After verifying\ndata and Login IDs, we believe that we are on the right track. Some of\nyou (our IBS clients) might notice your accounts displayed more than\nonce or additional accounts displayed that you may (or may not) want\ndisplayed on your IBS screen. Should this be the case, please e-mail (or\nphone) the information to us and we will remove this information right\naway.\n\nTo our IBS Billpayer clients:\n\nDuring this process, we seem to have misplaced (blown away) your bill\npayment information (particularly anyone that has [had] reoccurring\npayments scheduled to process on particular days). This has become our\nhighest priority to retrieve this information, thus alleviating the\nprocess of having to request that our IBS Billpayers re-enter this\ninformation. We are going to waive all bill payment charges for the\nmonths of November & December, 2001 to try and regain your confidence\n(and support).\n\nAgain, we deeply express our regrets and hope that we (yourselves and\nourselves) do not have to go through this process again. Should you be\none of our IBS clients that still has not gained access to your account\ninformation, please refer to the following information:\n\n1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was\nthe correct password) and been given the error message \"You have failed\nto correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or\ncontact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset.\" This is\nthe easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you\nonline (on the phone or by e-mail [our preferred method]). Should you\nreceive this message, please call our Computer Department and ask for\neither myself (Howard Gordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @\n830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @ 830-401-1182. If you reach our voice mail\n(or another employee), please leave your Name, Account # and call back\n#.\n\n2)  You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the\nssn# or tin# of the primary account holder). Please try again using the\nlast six (6) digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the\nprimary account holder.

Your account is one of the few that did not convert correctly\n(we will not release any information about these accounts until we\nverify that all information is correct and accurate). We are finalizing\nthese accounts today and should have them available for access this\nafternoon (late) or this evening. Once we release these accounts for IBS\naccess, you will have to again use the last six (6) digits of your ssn#\n(this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder), then you will\nbe directed to a screen that asks for information such as:\n\nName\nAddress\nCity, State Zip+4\nPhone #\nE-Mail Address\n\nAfter entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be\ninstructed to change your password to anything that you desire (you can\nat this point change your password back to what it was before).

We\nwill have this information updated by 6:00pm (hopefully), and then\ninformation will be as of Monday (11/19/01).
